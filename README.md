# Lead Isotope Analysis Plot Generator

> This app was created by students of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, and is maintained and modified by me under the MIT License.

Individual data points or a `.csv` file containing multiple data points can be added to the program, which will then generate 2D and 3D scatter plots of Lead Isotope ratios: <sup>206/204</sup>Pb, <sup>207/204</sup>Pb, and <sup>208/204</sup>Pb.

These can be compared to a database of other sources, grouped by country and region, located in the `database.xlsx` file. Feel free to update the database file with your own dataâ€”the password for editing is `4567`. This is simply an additional step to prevent accidental modifications.

**Adding more data to the main database file is highly appreciated.**

# Next Steps:

The next update will focus on improving the 2D plots by adding more customization options for each plot.
